  <h1>Appletify but better</h1>
 Made some changes to the original Appletify to bring back some of the spotify to appletify

_credit to [raysin1, the original creator](https://github.com/raysin1/Appletify) for this great theme_

**Changes I Made**

- removed the apple music home screen and brought back the regular spotify home screen
- fixed styling issues with resizing the spotify client
- made the menus bigger when resizing so all content can show
- fixed a bug which did not show the right font when an album was selected
